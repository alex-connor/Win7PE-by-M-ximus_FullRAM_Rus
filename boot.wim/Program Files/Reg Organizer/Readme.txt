  Description
  -----------

  This is an extensive and extremely powerful set of registry tools required
  for effective system registry management. This software lets you view, 
  edit, and safely clean the registry. It allows you to preview the registry
  files you want to import (including the ability to preview files directly
  from Windows Explorer) and supports editing the contents of the
  registry files. It includes registry cleaner, which will safely compact,
  repair, and optimize the registry. With Reg Organizer you can thoroughly
  search the registry to find all the keys related to a certain application; 
  Reg Organizer does this job quicker and better than other similar programs. 
  Other Reg Organizer features include the ability to find and replace registry
  entries, automatic registry cleanup, a Disk Cleanup tool, and access to many
  undocumented Windows features.
