------

1     Can I split a backup file into several smaller files that will each fit
      onto a CD (700 Mbytes), even if use compression?
      ------
      Yes. The total size of the file is as it is written (even after
      compression is used).
      Be aware that for this program 1Mb is equal to 1024*1024 bytes
      (everybody does not agree on Mb size, it is sometimes 1000*1000 or
      1000*1024 bytes).

2     Can Partition Saving copy only the occupied sectors of a partition?

3     Do you plan to provide such an option in the future?
      ------
      Since V2.20 you can save occupied sectors only for FAT12, FAT16, FAT32
      and ext2 partitions (also for NTFS partition since V2.30).
      I depend on OS information to determine which sections of a partition
      are occupied. Since I do not have this information for other partition
      types, occupied sectors only cannot be done for those.
      If you want to save place when saving partitions different from FAT,
      ext2 and NTFS one, you can use a program that set all bytes of
      unoccupied sectors of a partition to the same value such as with
      compression this will reduce amount of space needed. If you do not have
      such a program, you can use the advice from Mr Lumir Mik: write a
      program that creates a file and fills it with the same value. Then erase
      this file.

4     If I want to restore a partition, do I need to use an identical disc
      having the same format as the original?
      ------
      Yes if you have saved all sectors of the partition (that was the only
      option for versions prior to V2.20). Furthermore you can only restore a
      partition on an identical one and to the same disk location. It is a
      significant limitation but data can be dependent on the location of the
      partition on the hard disk. The limitation relating to the type of the
      partition can be resolved by writing the partition table when restoring,
      but it is a feature that I have not incorporated yet.
      Since version 2.20, if you saved only occupied sectors of a FAT or ext2
      partition (or NTFS for V2.30), you can restore it on a partition with a
      different format if certain size constraints are regarded. Nevertheless,
      the disk must have the same sector size as the saved partition, and the
      partition type must be the same (or must be compatible since V2.30).

5     Sometimes it takes a long time to switch from the maximum file size
      window to the save window. Why?
      ------
      This happens when you save your partition over an existing file. If this
      file is large (e.g. result of a previous backup), it takes DOS some time
      to delete it. Note that from version 2.10, the file is deleted between
      the file name window and the maximum file size one (or before the save
      window in the case of batch mode).

6     Using compression takes a long time. Would not it be quicker to save an
      uncompressed image file and use an archive utility to compress it later?
      ------
      It depends on the level of compression that you use with your archiver.
      If you use the maximum level you will waste time since you have to
      access the drive two more times. If you reduce the level of compression,
      you will save time but use more space. Note that starting from version
      2.10, you can choose a level of compression that will allow you to make
      a compromise between time required to save and disk space needed (for
      V2.00, the only level of compression was maximum).

7     Can I save NTFS partitions?
      ------
      Yes, you can. From version 2.30, you can even save occupied sectors
      only. However since Microsoft have never published specifications on
      NTFS structure, this was done with using some incomplete information and
      some rare features that appear in only a few instances are not
      supported.
      DOS being not able to access NTFS partitions, you need to have a FAT
      partition that can be read/write by DOS (either another partition on
      hard drive, or using network mount, ZIP disk, ...) or use the internal
      NTFS partition mounting in order to create backup files. Some programs
      allow DOS to use NTFS partitions (see http://www.cgsecurity.org or
      http://www.sysinternals.com, but be aware that last one is not
      compatible with Partition Saving) but in this case you should not use
      the saving a partition on itself feature.

8     Will Partition Saving preserve the long filenames on Windows partitions?
      ------
      Yes, it is one of the main goal of the program. Indeed, it is not
      possible to save/restore all files under Windows as some are protected
      because they are in use. Consequently they must be saved under DOS (or
      another OS that allows access to Windows partitions). But since DOS
      cannot recognize long filenames, either saving or restoring must be done
      at level where file notion does not exist, by physically saving the
      partition. Moreover this preserves the relative order of sectors, which
      may have an influence on the operation of some programs.

9     Is Partition Saving compatible with Windows NT, 2000 or XP?
      ------
      Yes, but you need to boot from a DOS floppy disk or CDROM and have
      access to a FAT partition (please read also question 7). From version
      3.00 you can also create saving files on NTFS partition, but for this
      you have first to create files from Windows with the dedicated option
      then boot to DOS to perform saving.

10    How do I create a boot floppy?
      ------
      You can use the bootable floppy disk based on FreeDOS that contains
      Partition Saving (see spartbdk documentation). You can also create your
      own floppy disk with MS-DOS.
      For Windows 9x, click: Start->Settings->Control Panel->Add/Remove
      Programs, choose the "Startup disk" tab. Insert an empty floppy disk
      into drive, and click on the "Create Disk" button.
      If this method is not available for Windows XP, you can choose the
      "Format" option by right-clicking on floppy drive in Windows Explorer
      and choose the "Copy system files" option. However in the case the
      floppy disk is not configured, you have to configure the floppy disk
      manually. For this purpose you have to create two text files CONFIG.SYS
      and AUTOEXEC.BAT on the floppy disk. In CONFIG.sys you have to install:

        - The CDROM driver file if you wish to use the CDROM drive. Its name
          is usually ATAPICD.SYS, CDROM.SYS or <your CDROM mark>.SYS (there
          are also some generic drivers that come with Windows). For the
          driver to be loader, you have to write "DEVICE=<file name>
          /D:<name>" where <file name> is the CDROM driver filename and <name>
          is any name of you choice that is less than 8 characters (ex:
          CD0001).
        - The driver file for the monitor. The one delivered by Windows is
          called DISPLAY.SYS. For it to be loaded you must write
          "DEVICE=DISPLAY.SYS CON=(EGA,,1)" (I doubt whether anybody does not
          have an EGA compatible monitor).
        - Finally you must configure the country (this is not needed for
          English people). To do that to must use COUNTRY.SYS file and write
          to CONFIG.SYS "COUNTRY=<number1>,<number2>,COUNTRY.SYS". The first
          number is the country code (033 for France) and the second one is
          the codepage that will be used (850 for France).

      In the second file (AUTOEXEC.BAT) you have to put:

        - The program providing access to the CDROM. This is provided by
          Windows and is called MSCDEX.EXE. To use it, you have to write
          "MSCDEX.EXE /D:<name>" where <name> is the same <name> written for
          the CDROM driver line in CONFIG.SYS.
        - The program that configures the codepage you use (it will allow you
          to configure your keyboard) (this is not needed for English people).
          For this purpose you need two lines, one to prepare the codepage and
          the second to select it: "MODE CON CODEPAGE PREPARE=((<number>)
          EGA.CPI)" is the first line and "MODE CON CODEPAGE SELECT=<number>"
          is the second one. Each <number> must be the same and must be equal
          to second number in the "COUNTRY" line of the CONFIG.SYS file
          (therefore 850 for France).
        - Finally the instruction to configure your keyboard correctly (e.g.
          for French people it will access AZERTY mode in place of QWERTY). To
          do this you have to write "KEYB FR,,KEYBOARD.SYS" FR that is the
          country code (for France, so you have to insert a different code for
          other languages, or omitting this line can work).

      To make sure all this works, you have to check that all files are on the
      floppy disk (CDROM driver, DISPLAY.SYS, COUNTRY.SYS, MSCDEX.EXE,
      EGA.CPI, KEYB.COM, MODE.COM, KEYBOARD.SYS). This is a minimal generic
      configuration (e.g. you can add mouse by adding a MOUSE.COM or MOUSE.EXE
      line (depends of file name) into AUTOEXEC.BAT file (and checking for the
      existence of this file on the floppy). For some countries instead of
      using KEYBOARD.SYS you may have to use KEYBRD2.SYS for certain
      keyboards).
      For others versions of Windows, or if what is described above does not
      work, search the Windows help files (search for something like "boot
      disk").
      You can also use the ready-made floppy disk published with
      Partition-Saving that is based on FreeDOS or any other ready-made floppy
      disk you can find.
      Note: if you have a Windows 9X boot disk, you can use it to save a
      Windows XP partition (you have to use at least a Windows 95 OSR2 boot
      disk if you want to access a FAT32 partition).
      Once the boot disk is created, copy the savepart.exe on it (use another
      floppy disk if there is insufficient free space, or a DOS accessible
      partition on hard drive). Then restart your computer with keeping floppy
      disk into drive. This floppy will boot. Once you have "A:\>" prompt,
      type <program directory>\savepart.exe (where <program directory> is
      where you put the savepart.exe (ex: C:\savepart\savepart.exe)) or change
      disk if you have written it to a separate floppy and run it.
      In case your computer does not boot from the floppy drive but still
      boots from the hard disk, you have to change boot sequence in the BIOS
      (consult BIOS documentation to learn how to do this).

11    Why does it take such a long time to create a backup file?
      ------
      Time required to write an image depends on 4 factors:

        - partition contents.
        - choosing to save only occupied sectors or all sectors.
        - compression level used.
        - whether you write the backup file to a hard-drive other than the one
          that contains the source partition.

      You also can speed up saving/restoring time by using -nvd and -nvf
      options. These options can really improve performances, but in case your
      disk begins to be damaged, some errors can be not found and that will
      result in a bad save or restoration. These options are on as a default
      beginning from version 3.80.
      Note: I get a 30% speed improvment using these options, but it seems it
      is very dependant on motherboard and disk, as some users report me
      getting a great speed improvment (up to 90%) when using these options.

      You can also use partition mounting instead of DOS access because it
      goes faster, but it needs you reboot computer at end of execution.

      Some people use also successfully DOS UDMA drivers, but you have first
      to find them and read how to use them.

      Regarding the compression level, here are some figures I obtained doing
      some trials (these depend on the computer and partition contents, but
      they are provided to give some idea), a standard figure of 100 has been
      adopted for uncompressed files:
       +-------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------+
       |                   | Time required VS. CPU speed (MHz) |           |
       | Compression level +---------+-------+--------+--------+ File size |
       |                   |   33    |  700  |  1700  |  Ave.  |           |
       +-------------------+---------+-------+--------+--------+-----------+
       |         0         |     100 |   100 |    100 |    100 |    100.00 |
       +-------------------+---------+-------+--------+--------+-----------+
       |         1         |     371 |   127 |     82 |    194 |     54.15 |
       +-------------------+---------+-------+--------+--------+-----------+
       |         2         |     384 |   130 |     83 |    199 |     53.53 |
       +-------------------+---------+-------+--------+--------+-----------+
       |         3         |     419 |   137 |     84 |    213 |     53.06 |
       +-------------------+---------+-------+--------+--------+-----------+
       |         4         |     449 |   142 |     85 |    225 |     52.33 |
       +-------------------+---------+-------+--------+--------+-----------+
       |         5         |     525 |   156 |     88 |    256 |     51.86 |
       +-------------------+---------+-------+--------+--------+-----------+
       |         6         |     644 |   179 |     94 |    306 |     51.64 |
       +-------------------+---------+-------+--------+--------+-----------+
       |         7         |     729 |   194 |     99 |    341 |     51.57 |
       +-------------------+---------+-------+--------+--------+-----------+
       |         8         |    1065 |   255 |    118 |    479 |     51.53 |
       +-------------------+---------+-------+--------+--------+-----------+
       |         9         |    1595 |   348 |    150 |    697 |     51.51 |
       +-------------------+---------+-------+--------+--------+-----------+
      As you can see the higher the deflating level, the greatest the time
      required. Also very little space is gained beyond the first setting (in
      some rare case (not shown here), you can even loose space). So choosing
      the maximum compression level is not the best option (even more for a
      slow processor).
      Worthy of note is in case where you have a powerful processor, it takes
      less time to compress the data (low level) than to write it
      uncompressed.
      Remark: restoration time is not really dependent upon compression level
      (disregarding the case of zero compression).

12    I cannot manage to create the backup file on CD.
      ------
      CD burner manufacturers rarely provide DOS driver for their hardware. So
      you must first save backup files to your hard drive. Then when you boot
      into an OS from where you can burn CDs, you can create a CD with these
      files on. Be aware to not use a too high burning speed because some
      people get problems to read CD from DOS because of a too high burning
      speed.

13    Are files created using a prior version compatible with the current one?
      ------
      This information is in the changes.txt file. As a general rule, files
      created with an older version can be used by a more recent version. The
      converse is often true, but not in the case of a new type of filesystem.

14    What can be done in case of error?
      ------
      As a general rule you can contact me by mail
      <damien.guibouret@partition-saving.com> and I will try to answer you as
      soon as possible. I will need all details on what happens (what you want
      to do, what options you choose, ...). Moreover if error message has a
      "Call tree:" or "Call frame traceback:" appears, you have to send me
      following values (at least the 10 first). It will allow me to find
      easily where error occurs. In answer, I can ask you more details (as
      downloading diskinfo/partinfo/fileinfo program) or to do some tries to
      better understand what happens.

15    Drive letter seems not to be correct. How can I know which is the
      partition I want to save?
      ------
      This problem can occur by example when you have NTFS partitions. As DOS
      is not able to recognize them, a drive letter will not be assigned to it
      and those assigned to FAT partitions are shifted. The simplest way to
      know which drive a partition is, is to give to each partition a
      different name. As this name is displayed, you just have to choose the
      one that has the name of those to save. But for FAT partition, partition
      name can be stored into two places, and depending on those that is
      taken, it can seem to be wrong. In the same way if a FAT partition has
      "NO NAME" as name, it is because it has no name (and not because it has
      the name "NO NAME"). In this case, another way to know which partition
      to choose, is to look at the size of the partition.
      From version 3.80, a new method allows finding the partitions to use:
      -fp and -ff options do program searches for a partition with relying on
      some marking file you created on it from your usual OS. You only need to
      be sure this file does not appear at the same place on two drives.

16    When I run program, nothing appears.
      ------
      This can be a problem with screen display. Try using program with -bui
      option (savepart -bui). If nothing appears again, try -cui option
      (savepart -cui). If there is still nothing on screen, problem is
      certainly not with screen display and so it is better to contact me.

17    What can be done when I get the error message "A sector containing
      parameters for filesystem cannot be read"?
      ------
      This message is displayed when program has found incoherency into
      filesystem or when a filesystem sector is damaged. One thing that can be
      done is to try to repair it with corresponding program ("scandisk <drive
      letter>:" for Windows 9x/ME, "chkdsk /f <drive letter>:" for Windows
      NT/(2000 ?), "chkdsk /p <drive letter>:" for Windows XP/(2000 ?), "fsck
      <device name>" for Linux). If error is due to a bad sector you have to
      do surface test to try to correct it. Once it is done, you can try
      saving partition again. If it still does not work and that is not due to
      a bad sector you can contact me.

18    Can I save my partition on an USB storage device?
      ------
      Yes, you can as there was now some USB drivers for DOS. So you can
      download one, add it into CONFIG.SYS file and use the newly created
      drive to write saving file on. To find an USB driver for DOS and get
      more help on it, you can search on Internet or take a look at
      http://www.stefan2000.com/darkehorse/PC/DOS/Drivers/USB/ (the one I try
      without any problem is the Motto Hairu one, but I did not try the
      CD-writer feature as I do not have an USB one). Please notice that some
      people get an error message telling that file cannot be created or
      written. In this case, if it is not because file already exists and has
      read-only flag, you have to use the "-nvf" option for program to work
      (note: in case you access your USB storage device through mount, you
      have to use the "-nvd" option).
      From version 3.80, -nvf and -nvd becomes default options, so you should
      no more encounter this problem.

19    Can I perform incremental backup?
      ------
      Incremental backup is not available and will certainly never be.
      Partition Saving saves sectors and not files. So to know if a sector
      shall be saved again, it would have to compare each sector one by one,
      that can be very long and do that a lot of sectors are saved again in
      case of operation that modify a lot of sectors (as defragmenting).

20    Can I extract only some files from backup?
      ------
      From version 3.30, this can be done with using "Explore a backup" option
      and can also be used with files created with previous versions. This
      needs that all backup files can be read simultaneously.
      Before this version, this was available but only with FAT partition with
      using driver mechanism. As it can be run only from DOS, this allows only
      extracting short name files.

21    Will my SATA/RAID/... disk be recognised?
      ------
      I cannot answer you, as I cannot test all disks and controller types. As
      a generalisation, if it is natively supported into your BIOS, you will
      certainly not have problem. You can perhaps need to get some DOS drivers
      for it to work. The simplest way is to try: if disk appears into disk
      list with a correct size, then displayed partition table is correct and
      for a known type partition, saving occupied sectors only is available,
      there will certainly be no problem. For information I got some people
      telling me that they have no problem with their SATA or RAID disk
      (thanks to them for information).
      A good way to know if your disk is supported by your BIOS: if you can
      boot on it, there shall be no problem (less a potential size problem if
      your BIOS cannot access more than 128 Gb).
      From 3.50 version, you can use the Windows version of Partition Saving
      if you cannot access your disk from DOS and you have the Windows
      drivers.

22    Displayed partition table is empty or has only one partition when I know
      there are several, what is wrong?
      ------
      If partition table is empty, this can be because program found an
      incoherence in it (some partitions overlap, end after disk end, ...).
      You can download partinfo.zip to display it and see what is wrong.
      If you get only one partition when several are defined, this can be
      because of dynamic disk usage (new partitioning scheme that is not
      supported in DOS version) or because of using some security program as
      Norton GoBack. In first case, you can use the Windows version with using
      Windows devices (do not save the whole disk as dynamic disk allows
      putting information on several disks and so some data will be missing).
      In second case, you have to deactivate the corresponding program (refer
      to this program documentation to know how to perform it).

23    How can I reach the "mount partition/use automatic naming" window
      without mouse?
      ------
      This window can be reached with using Alt+Tab (twice in case window
      giving free space on drives is displayed) or Ctrl+Tab keys. To come back
      to window to enter filename, you have to use one of these keys
      combinations again.
      Note: from version 3.20, mount partition button is into the window
      requesting for filename, so changing window is no more needed to reach
      it.

24    I cannot create files on NTFS partition.
      ------
      This is standard program behaviour: from DOS it is not able to create
      files on a NTFS partition. You have to create files from Windows with
      the corresponding program option (or with creating empty files with
      Windows explorer), then boot back to DOS to be able to use these files
      as backup files with mounting the corresponding partition.

25    My computer does not have a floppy drive. How can I start with DOS?
      ------
      You have to create a bootable CD. For this:

        - either you have another computer with a floppy drive that allows you
          creating this CD. In this case, you have to create the bootable
          floppy disk as described into question 10, then with your burning CD
          software you have to create a bootable CD: it will request you this
          floppy disk when it needs it to perform an image and burn it onto
          CD.
        - or you do not have any other computer. In this case you have to use
          an existing image of a bootable floppy disk or CD that you can use
          with your burning software. You can either use image provided with
          Partition Saving bootdisk (see chapter 2.b of spartbdk
          documentation), or some burning programs provide their own bootdisk
          image or others images can be found on Internet.

      Another way is to not use the DOS version, but a Windows version with
      creating a WinPE or BartPE CD.
      A last way is to use a bootable USB disk or key if your computer allows
      booting from it.

26    Why do I get a message telling me a file cannot be created/written?
      ------
      There can be several reasons for this error:

        - Support cannot be written (write protected disk).
        - File or directory is write protected.
        - Mount is read-only: when you mount a partition, you get a message
          giving the mount number and if it is writable with or without file
          creation or if it is read-only.
          If mount is read-only, it can be because it was badly unmounted last
          time it was used. In this case you have to check the filesystem
          (with scandisk, chkdsk, e2fsck, ...). It shall be noticed that in
          all cases, mounting a NTFS partition does not allow creating files
          (only changing size of existing ones).
        - You try to write an USB support. Some BIOS and drivers does not
          allow using file writting check, in this case you have to use the
          "-nvf" option (or "-nvd" if you access it through mount) when
          running program (savepart -nvf).

27    Why not allowing creation of file of more than 2047Mb (to fill up a
      DVD)?
      ------
      This limitation comes from a filesystem that does not allow having
      bigger file and it will remain to ensure compatibility. For the specific
      case of a DVD, you can fill it up with choosing a file size compatible
      with the DVD maximum size. As an example, with creating files of 1550Mb,
      you can fill a DVD with three files per DVD.

28    I can no more create backup file on saved partition even with choosing
      to save it on itself?
      ------
      This was modified with V3.50. From this version when saving a partition
      on itself you have to use the mount mechanism to access saved partition,
      you can no more use DOS drive. When choosing option to save partition on
      itself, it is automatically mounted (if you do not mount another
      partition before, it is 0: drive).

29    With Windows version, I do not see my system partition or program tells
      me it cannot protect access to support?
      ------
      With Windows version, program needs to disallow other programs to access
      to saved partition, else it can lead to some incoherence into backup.
      But this cannot be done if some files are already opened on this saved
      partition. This is always the case for system partition. So either it
      does not appear into list of partition to select or its use is not
      authorised.
      In order to save your system partition, you have to do it either from
      another Windows installation, or with a WinPE or BartPE CD, or from
      Windows Vista recovery console.

30    Can I change drive letter of my Windows installation from X: to C:?
      ------
      Once Windows is installed with a given drive letter, you can no more
      change this drive letter (unless reinstalling it). Option provided by
      Partition-Saving is to treat case where you save your Windows system and
      restore it on another partition than this origin partition. It allows
      you to change drive letter of this new partition for it to get the same
      drive letter than the origin one such as Windows appears to not have
      been moved.

31    Can Partition-Saving be used with 512e disks (4 KB sectors disks
      emulating 512 bytes sectors)?
      ------
      There is no problem using Partition-Saving with these disks. It is
      recommended that partitions get 4 KB aligned to improve performance, but
      as Partition-Saving does not create partitions, this is not a problem
      for it but for program used to create partitions. The only case where
      Partition-Saving "creates" partitions is when restoring partitions
      table, but as in this case aim is to get the same partitions table than
      origin one, it will not try to modify it.
