POSTCARD.TXT, last change 98-03-05, Oliver Pieper
===========================================================

After long deliberation I've decided that my utilities will
no longer be available for free.

But, don't worry, I'm not after your money 8-)

I've got a lot of feedback concerning my programs and the
fascinating thing is, that I've exchanged e-mail with people
from all over the world.

But only e-mail, which is, after all, just virtual mail,
nothing real.

So, instead of asking for money (which only a few people
would actually pay), I ask for a postcard. If you use any of
my utilities or add-on tracks and trucks, or just liked my texts
on texture and truck editing, I'd really like to receive a
postcard from you. Only one, it's not necessary to send one for
every program or add-on product you use.

Take a look at my postcard page at
http://www.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/~pieper/mtm to see the
cards that have been sent so far (39 cards as of March 5, 98). 

At the moment, the list of my creations includes (but is not
necessarily limited to):
Utilities:
- TrackMate			- PODMate			- BINMate
- TrackView			- BINedit			- PODList
Miscellaneous:
- ckban.bin (checkpoint banner w/o number)
- METALCR2.PAL, CIRCUIT.PAL, DRAG.PAL, RALLY.PAL 
- new truck cockpit COCKPIT.POD
- Hall of Mirrors fix BACKFIX.POD
- texts on texture and truck editing
- new maple wood cockpit CP_MAPLE.POD
Trucks:
- Sim's Special (the Lawnmower)
- Red Devil
- Police Bronco
Tracks:
- Unreal
- Derailed
- Dark Star

Everyone should be able to afford a postcard, usually it doesn't
cost much more to send one to Germany than to send one to the
neighbors...

Send the postcard (preferably with a picture of you, your house,
your town, your state or your country 8-)) to:

	Oliver Pieper
	Weissdornweg 26
	D-35041 Marburg
	Germany

And don't forget to mention your name and where you live. If you
add your e-mail address, I'll notify you of the arrival of the card.

Thanks, and enjoy my programs and add-ons!
