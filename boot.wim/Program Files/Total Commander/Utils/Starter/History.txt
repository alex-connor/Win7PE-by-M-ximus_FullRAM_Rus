5.6.2.0 (23 Jan 2006)
~~~~~~~~~~
INF: Services tab seems finished.
ADD: Option to store settings in a file instead of registry.
     If the file is ReadOnly, it will not be updated and any settings you change will not be saved.
     This is the search order for settings location:
     1. File specified in the commandline: -inifile <filename>
     2. Starter.ini in the same directory as Starter.exe, only if the file exists
     3. Starter.ini in user's profile directory (%USERPROFILE%, usually 'C:\Documents and Settings\'), only if the file exists
     4. Starter.ini in Windows' directory (e.g C:\Windows\), if exists
     5. Registry, as before
     Note: .ini file name depend on .exe name: "Starter v5.6.2.0.exe" will search for "Starter v5.6.2.0.ini" file, not "Starter.ini"
CHG: Modified caption button to somewhat support XP Themes. But I still want to remove it.
ADD: Option: Navigator\'Use flat style for buttons'. On by default.
