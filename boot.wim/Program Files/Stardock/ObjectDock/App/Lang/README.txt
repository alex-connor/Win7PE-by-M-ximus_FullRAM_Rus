Note! *Lang files MUST be unicode, regardless of if language is unicode.*


Also, ensure you maintain spaces as they are in the file, and do not quote
your strings.

How the system works, is that EXACTLY everything before the = sign is swapped
with EXACTLY everything that comes after it, up to the newline character.
