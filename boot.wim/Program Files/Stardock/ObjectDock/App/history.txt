v1.9 release
------------
-Brand new awesome weather docklet! New docklet uses brand new technology to fly out your 5 day forecast when you click on it or hover over it, and hides it when your mouse goes away.

-Zoomin/Zoomout smoothness *significantly* enhanced, and is now adjustable! Find the new options in the "Quality & Performance" settings

-ObjectDock now comes bundled with some really great artwork (icons and backgrounds) from the community. (Permission recieved to use all of the images involved).

-New artwork has been pre-associated with over 50 different programs! As result, chances are if you add a program, it will show up with a nice high-resolution icon!

-New minimize effect on Vista! When Live Thumbnails are in use on Vista and your dock is showing a taskbar, windows will now do a nice minimize animation into any zooming dock. I

-Live minimize effect should be smoother than any other program available! Effort was made to make it work with minimal to no interference to your workflow, and the animation should never jump around / flicker heavily at the end unlike other versions of this effect you may have seen.

-"Live previews" for files and folders are enabled! While folders will not have their icons update automatically if their contents change, when loaded folders will show as their correct preview. The same with other types of documents that offer a live preview (PDF's, etc)

-In Vista, all minimized windows will show up as a live mini-thumbnail in the ObjectDock taskbar! Optionally you can have all windows, minimized or not, show up as thumbnails. Note: this feature is only
available for zooming docks, it does not support tabbed docks.

-New background ability! Tile-based backgrounds can now adjust the size/position of the original icon, end result, really cool tiled backgrounds. Check out the included HyperGrass theme for an example of how cool tiled backgrounds can now be!

-Completely redone the mouse-activation / layering system. See the new "interaction" area in zooming dock's positioning options. The new interaction abilities should make ObjectDock a much more pleasent program to use!

-Custom icons set for program file shortcuts now automatically sync with custom icons set for windows of a program in taskbars.

-Entry areas in shortcut dialogs now use AutoComplete

-Entering in generic terms or filetypes such as "internet", "email", ".doc", etc for a shortcut will now

-Background code *significantly* improved.

-New "Troubleshooting" dialog with quick access to disabling features of ObjectDock

-Increased drawing optimization code's ability to manage images. Should result in quicker than ever drawing and decreased memory usage for zooming docks.

-Docks can now not only be left/right/center aligned, but anywhere in-between. See the new slider in zooming dock's positioning options


-Brand new "Show Start Menu" functionality! Will show your existing startmenu/startpanel right next to the cursor when you click it. Add one by right clicking dock and choosing "Add -> New Start Menu Entry"

-"Add" menus now significantly more useful ; they now give you the option to add a wide variety of different built-in entries

-New "command entry" abilities! You can now create a dock item to toggle autohide on and off, or toggle hiding/showing the taskbar. Very useful!

-New option available to turn on "proportionate stretching" for backgrounds

-New mode available in plus: "keep on top, hiding off-screen for maximized applications", which makes the dock always on top except when a window is maximized, at which point it will automatically temporarily turn on autohide

-Improved dock's ability to judge what maximum size it should be. Dock will now exactly fill the screen when you set it to be as large as possible, and it will properly maintain this as you add/remove items.

-Brand new taskbar modes available in Plus! Your taskbar can now be set to show "all windows", "minimized windows only", or "non-minimized windows only"

-Dramatically improved behavior during right click menus on zooming docks. When you right click and the dock's zooming locks in position, if you click/right-click on another item ObjectDock will now correctly select the item that your cursor was over at the time, not what i would be after the zoom lock is released. Similarly, if you begin dragging an item while locked, the program will behave appropriately instead of its prior very unpredictable behavior.

-Improved handling / awareness of full-screen applications

-Completely redone system tray mechanism for Plus, which is more lighweight and does not require any additional resident EXE (that’s right, sdmcp.exe will be a thing of the past :)) System tray will not currently work on 64-bit versions of Windows, but they do work with Windows Vista, including the new "Special" tray icons in Vista.

-Performance and memory usage has been improved. Lots of optimizing for CPU usage.

-Every single 'glitchy' behavior that we/users could find in previous versions of ObjectDock has been fixed
-When using extension-only in shortcuts, the item's title will now automatically update to the name of the application, not just its filename.
-Ability added for ObjectDock to apply included default images for programs that do not have high-resolution icons already included with them. For example, a default Notepad shortcut on XP would use the included custom high-quality icon, but on Vista where a high-quality icon is available for Notepad, ObjectDock will use the actual Notepad icon.
-Improved system tray, should now work more reliably than ever! Outlook 2007 and Windows Live Messenger should both now work reliably.
-Fixed up a couple minor resource leaks
-Improved taskbars / thumbnail behavior.
-Added option to turn off tabbed docks' ability to automatically dock to the edge as a drawer when dragging. Option available in "misc options".
-Fixed multimonitor issue with the Start Menu functionality, and added better problem-notification.
-Fixed issue with flyouts where if they contained 9+ items and zooming is disabled, they could show up partially behind the dock.
-UI improvments
-Ability to export backgrounds added to the DockZip packaging format. Try this feature today by right clicking the dock and choosing "Pack images for sharing"
-Dialog flow / layout improved for zooming docks
-Colorizing a background now also colorizes the indicators you've selected to use
-When packing up icons, you can now reliably drag dock items on to the "packager" dialog, and the icon associated with that item will automatically be added to the package you're creating
-Improved autohide ability in general. Also, added ability for autohide to give activation back to the window that had it if an autohidden dock gets activated temporarily and then hides.
-improved shortcuts so that the dock longer pauses for a moment when you run something
-improved delete-item animation so that there is no longer a delay when you delete something from the dock
-clicking empty space directly above/below a zooming dock that is still part of the background (e.g. a shadow) no longer causes the dock item below it to get selected. similarly, right clicking that area will bring up options for the dock itself, not the item below where you clicked.
-On Vista, Taskbar should now show / be able to interact with applications ran as administrator when UAC is enabled in vista, even if ObjectDock isn't elevated. (Minimize animations will not work for programs ran as administrator however)
-Fixed issue where icons for url-shortcuts would not get remembered
-Can now drag/drop "Internet" and "Email" shortcuts from start panel into dock
-ObjectDock is better than ever at picking up the best high-quality icon for your file, particularly in Windows Vista.
-You can now zoom icons up to 256x256.


1.50 release
------------

-Added support/fixes for Windows Vista. No more 'ghost' window,
32-bit icons are supported, etc.)
-Added a centralized place to store all your ObjectDock images,
backgrounds, and other files. Look for your "ObjectDock Library"
in your "My Documents" folder. .DockZip files will attempt to
extract there automatically.
-Added Search options to image browser. It will search globally across
your ObjectDock Library folders (under My Documents) as well
as the ObjectDock program folder and subfolders.
across your ObjectDock folder and subfolders.
-Added "Reserve edge of screen" ability for zooming docks
-Added improved zoom algorithm for smoother painting.
-Added Docklet crash protection technology, which helps preventing
anything from happening to your dock even if a 3rd party docklet
that you've downloaded experiences a problem.
-Added tabbed dock resizing help. Grabbing the resizing-edge
of the dock has been made significantly easier. The resize arrow
is now shown for the full area between the edge of the content
and the edge of the dock itself, not just for a small border within it.
-Added ability for tabbed docks to auto-switch tabs when you activate
a dock with your mouse. Look in the advanced dialog to enable this.
-Added - If on any kind of dock you hover over a window in a taskbar while
dragging, that window will come to the foreground.
-Added - In tabbed docks, if at any time you hover over the plus/minus signs
while dragging/dropping, the dock will scroll for you so you can find the
right spot for your entry
-Added - Drag & drop onto target enabled in tabbed docks
-Added - Drag & drop onto shortcuts now allowed when dropping onto an EXE.
-Added - Enhanced drag-and-drop-on-targets so it behaves more seemlessly in zooming docks
-Added - Tabbed docks now auto-rotate when you drag them to an adjacent edge of the screen
-Added - Reloading icons when current icon package changes
-Added - Ability for autohidden zooming docks to show themselves for X number of
seconds before autohiding when they first load, at which point they wont autohide
still unless the mouse has been moved. This helps prevent forgetting where a dock
is on startup...if the computer is started while the user is away, when they return
the dock will still be there until they move the cursor.
-Added - The config dialog for applications (taskbar items) now allow you to
drop an image file onto them to set their image, like the rest
of the config dialogs in the program.
-Reenabled ability for tray icons to have their original icon show
small in the corner even if you've customized its icon. Click and hold
a tray icon to get at this option.

-Always on bottom docks will now no longer steal focus from the
foreground application unless clicked on.
-Removed Yahoo from search docklet

-Fixed issue with trouble double clicking tray icons
-Fixed "foreground" background support
-Fixed issue where if user put a registry path (e.g. ".html") as a shortcut
link the link wouldn't work properly when some browsers e.g. firefox were
set as the default.
-Fixed issue where separators on tabbed docks could not be dragged (and thus moved or removed)
-Fixed major issue involving dragging existing items, in which animations would
begin to heavily lag and ObjectDock would become temporarily unresponsive
on drag and drop operations that are not completly quickly.
-Fixed issue with the top 64 pixels of fully-zoomed icons not being
clickable when zoomed to a full 192 pixels.
-Fixed issue with Always-On-Bottom zooming docks, where the dock would flicker
some whem moving to the front and back again.
-The Calendar docklet for ObjectDock has a grey outline around it (as if
the bounding box of the docklet were not transparentized)
-Fixed issue where some rare tray icons who have active popups as their
main window, would become inaccessable when you open them via the tray.
-Fixed issue with always on bottom docks where configuring some items
would be a challenge as the diloags would keep going into the background
once the mouse left the dock. Instead, the dock is not allowed to move to
the back when config dialogs are open.
-Fixed issue with the background-skinning of zooming docks attached to
the left or right side of the screen. The caps on the top and bottom
would not always be the proper size.
-Fixed issue where if there were no items on a zooming dock, its
background would have a strange behavior and not display properly
-Fixed dock issue where if it were set to be always-on-bottom, when you
did a drag-and-drop it would snap back to the background on release.
-Fixed issue of authiding zooming docks not immediatly re-hiding after
you configure them and close the config dialog.
-Fixed issue where systray would exhibit a "shift right" graphical
glitch when a program is exited that existed in the tray.
-Fixed rock/swing/glow alternate mouseover effects
not working properly when no background is in use by the dock
-Fixed issue where if you were using a tile background
and using a rock/swing/glow effect, the tiles could sometimes
quickly disappear during a mouseover

1.30 release
---------

-PLUS-Enabled activation in Plus build

-BOTH-Added ability to offset dock from edge of the screen

-PLUS-"Automatic distance from edge" (place above taskbar) feature
now fully compatible with multi-monitors. This handy feature ("auto
distance from edge") is only available in the Plus version, and is
enabled by default in the plus version.

-PLUS-Added mouse-activation (different from hotspots) ability for
tabbed docks whose tabs are not always on top. When mouse activation
is checked, docked tabbed docks whose tabs are not AOT will come to
the front when you hit the edge of the screen directly over where
they are for the specified time period.

-BOTH-Not always-on-top tabbed docks that are docked to the edge of
the screen (autohidden) will now un-autohide if you choose from from
the alt-tab list.

-PLUS-Added ability for tabbed docks to reserve the entire edge of the
screen that they are on. Adjustable to be autohidden or not
autohidden.

-PLUS-When dragging docks that are reserving the edge of the screen,
they will detach and turn off their reserve-edge option upon pulling
far away from the edge. If moved back to the edge or to another edge
while in the same move/drag operation, the dock will automatically
re-reserve the edge space upon docking to an edge. Under other/normal
circumstances (just usual docking to the edge), the dock will not
automatically reserve the edge of the screen.

-PLUS-When in "My Docks" dialog, all autohidden or not-on-top
zooming and tabbed docks should come to the front and become
interactive. Upon leaving the application completly, docks go back to
their original positions.

-BOTH-When in the properties dialog for a
individual dock (zoomer or tabbed), that dock will temporarilly
ignore its autohidden and AOT state if present to make itself on-top
and visible to the user.

-PLUS-When using the configuration dialog for a dock, a bouncing
arrow will show up to identify which dock is currently being edited.
Similarly, when in the "My Docks" dialog, upon selecting a dock from
the dock listing, that dock will have a bouncing identifying arrow
pointing to it to identify which dock is currently selected. This
feature can be disabled from the advanced options, and when shown due
to a configuration dialog being active (not "My Docks"), the arrow
will fade out after 5 bounces to prevent it from becoming annoying.
The arrows only show up when there is more than one dock present (and
so are not necessary in the free version).

-BOTH-"Send To" now displays and works in system context menus for
files/folders within ObjectDock.

-PLUS-(less significant change)-In tabbed docks, more effectivly
separated the options for "Always on Top" and "Tabs Always On Top".
Tabbed docks maintain two AOT settings...usual AOT has effect only
when not docked to edge, and "tabs AOT" has effect only when docked.
Checkboxes in the dialog and context menus will change themselves
accordingly based on the current mode (docked or not).

-PLUS-Similarly, the option for if the tabbed dock appears in the
systray or taskbar when not AOT is kept seperatly for when docked and
undocked. This is the case as when just floating and not AOT, by
default the user will want to have it accessible via taskbar as there
is no other means. But if docked to the edge, it is more likly that
they don't want it in their taskbar, but rather they want to access
it by mouse activation (bumping the edge of the screen). Thus, this
allows automatic defaults to accomidate each scenario.

-BOTH-(minor change)-Added ability to set "Autohide" from context
menu of zooming dock

-PLUS-Fixed bug where in changing themes or shutting down, if more
than 1 tabbed dock is present not all tabbed docks have their
resources freed properly

-BOTH-Found and fixed 'handles' leak upon each use of context menus
for File/Folder dock items, amoung a few other small places (such as
during the poof animation)

-PLUS-Changed default tab appearance (e.g. on creation of a new
tabbed dock) to the "Simple Tabs" look.

-BOTH-New logo images in config dialogs for both plus and free
version

-BOTH-Fixed bug, when zoomed dock uses autohide, when you run an app
from the dock you can still click it even when it has disappeared
until the "running" animation ends.

-BOTH-auto-save 5 last 5 crashes into ObjectDock folder

-PLUS ONLY-Added ability to automatically place dock on edge of
screen, above the taskbar

-Updated Free-version's dialogs (the main dialog only. the nicer
for-each-item dialog are still plus-only)

-BOTH-Trash icon did not update automatically when a folder is
dropped onto it. Fixed.

-BOTH-Added 100ms delay in updating the trashcan's image, so that it
will refresh to the proper image when just the standard windows icon
is being used. (eg when no *custom* images are being used for the
trash)

-BOTH-Tweaked drag & drop on zooming docks, fixed issues involving
glitchy drop targets when the taskbar (and systray) is disabled

1.02 RC1
--------

-Repaired all known handle leaks! Major fix
-Icon size sliders no longer snap to preset values, you are free to choose any size.
-high probability that firefox freezing on activate problem has been fixed.
-100% CPU when using nVidia's VWM "nView". This has been fixed.
-Taskbar reshowing when its supposed hidden, most often during flashing
on dual displays: this has been fixed.
-Taskbar on zoomer not displaying right
-Calendar refreshed (yes, I know we need to tweak the image alignment slightly)
-Clock docklets consolidated

Things not addressed:
-combing through weather docklet code
-zoomer dock being unhappy when completely empty
-old separator remaining when switching to a new
zoomer dock without one (not sure if this is a problem
still)
-100% cpu condition with power meter (nvidia fixes
might help)
-report of no fonts for tab labels
-report of forgetting to stay always on top
-we're not seeing the 100% transparent issue with
the zoomer dock here so far, is it still happening for people?

There will be another RC build or two next week, but we're
in buttoning up mode with major things right now. No new
features.

1.02 beta3
----------
-attempted fixes for reports of firefox causing a crash when reactivating it
-screensaver icons not getting removed should be fixed
-crashed windows don't disappear from taskbar at times, and always when grouped. This has been fixed.
-For tooltips (e.g. in tray) with newline symbols, spaces are now shown for them instead of boxes (sorry, no multiline tooltips anytime soon)
-http:// links will now get the web document icon not question mark.
-General options (e.g. label font) don't save properly if no normal dock. This has been fixed.
-Font changes don't have effect until restart of program at times. This has been fixed.
-Flyouts would not operate correctly if you had a tabbed dock and a zooming dock, then closed the zoom dock. They would, however, resume working once the program was restarted. This has been fixed, no zooming dock is needed at all anymore for flyouts to work properly.
-Memory would leak when all of the following were true simultaniously: (1) a system tray tab was present on a tabbed dock, (2) one or more icons in the tray were set to show small representations of their icons in the corner, (3) that tab is not selected and (4) those icons animated frequently
-Zooming docks showing on monitors other than the primary would have their labels show up on the primary monitor. This has been fixed, labels are now correctly positions with docks placed on other monitors.
-ObjectDock would crash when creating a new dock, or (closer to the root of the problem:) when adding a 'Start Menu' entry. This has been fixed! (This problem would have effected crashes in flyouts and other shortcuts potentially also ; this is an important fix)
-Adding TIF images to the dock could crash it under some circumstances. This has been fixed.
-Fixed potential issue with adding non-32bit icons to dock and having it crash.
-Adding an application to the dock via "Add App to Dock" menu option when right clicking windows now makes a shortcut with the full path of the program, not just filename
-Add a way to get to the about box (from the tray icon)
-A zooming dock set to not always be on top will no longer animate when the mouse is over another program, that happens to be covering a portion of the dock. Under the new behavior, it will only animate when the cursor is actually over a visible part of the dock.

1.02 beta2
----------
-When there are no non-tabbed docks open, flyout menus would fly out, but then not react to mouse interaction . This has been fixed.
-Control+Click (or Shift+Clicking) on a folder in a flyout menu will open that folder instead of flying it out.
-Dock Properties dialog doesn't show on the Taskbar tabs when open. Fixed, it now shows.
-Made 'slowest' setting for hotspot activation delay much longer, relabled "fast/slow" delay to "short/very long"
-Advanced option added: folder flyouts show as normal menu if number of files > 80
-Add this Application to the Dock only works on flyout docks and it does not add the app icon as the image. Fixed, now works for all.
-non-tabbed docks set to normal zordering (not always on top) would come to the top when a new application was loaded. Fixed, this does no longer happen.
-Made hotspots screen colorblind friendly. (User must set BlackAndWhiteConfig flag in [Accessibility] section of settings.ini to = 1)
-added option for drawers (tabbed docks docked to edge) to not always have their tabs on top
-Tabbed dock labels show even when covered by another program and you mouseover a spot where an item would be if not covered. Fixed, this no longer happens.
-GDI Handles would leak after using Choose Image dialog. This has been fixed.
-When two tabbed docks are present, autohiding/showing them both at the same time can result in one of their animations locking and not hiding/unhiding again until restarting OD+. This has been fixed!
-If alt-tabbing during resizing the dock, the dock could get stuck in resizing if you move to another program then release the mouse button. This has been fixed.
-Resize cursor could get stuck temporarilly when moving quickly between two different tabbed docks. Fixed.
-Microsoft WordXP would freeze on shutdown until ObjectDock is closed when launched from a link to a word document in the dock. This has been determined to be resulting from a bug in Windows' ShellExecuteEx function, and has been effectivly worked around by removing running indicators on documents executed from the dock.
-Fixed issue of some users with only PowerUser windows user accounts not being able to run OD+, getting a message about needing to install properly.
-When moving a tabbed dock, upon picking it up to move it it would shift over a few pixels right from the start. Fixed.
-Added ability to have a System Tray on a non-tabbed dock! (You can choose between either having a taskbar or a tray on each non-tabbed dock)
-Tweaks for users with serial problems under limited or power user accounts.
